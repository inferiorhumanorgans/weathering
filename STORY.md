## Hopes and dreams

* As an ops person I expect to be deploying and maintaining the CI system.
  * I should be able to deploy, configure, and maintain CI system with as much or as little automation as desired.

  * I should be able to deploy the CI system (server and agent) easily to platforms other than Linux, OSX, or Windows.

  * I should be able to deploy to systems with limited memory

* As an application developer I expect to be the end user of this CI system.

  * I should be able to use one instance of the CI system to manage multiple branches within a project as well as multiple projects.

  * I should be able to customize the CI system easily. I should not have to use platform specific scripts to accomplish generic tasks.  I should not have to use arcane languages (e.g. CoffeeScript) to extend the CI system.

  * I should be able to integate the CI system with all of the other tools I use via common conventions like webhooks

  * I should be able to validate and test my build scripts with ease.

* As a human being

  * I should have acecss to clear documentation that is up to date with the code, defines best practices, and has a comprehensive API reference.

  * I expect that the CI system should get out of my way and not need a lot of attention once it's been setup.

  * I should not have to install a multitude of languages and tools to get the CI system installed and running.
